## "What's in this repository?"

This is a template repository for creating online courses in higher education created for the DiLER (Digital Literacy for Empirical Research) project, financed by DigiTeLL (Goethe-University Frankfurt).

Bruce is attempting a very simple book using this template. Just updated gh-pages to v4 since that seems required. Also fixed repo address
